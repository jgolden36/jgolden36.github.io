## Job market Paper (forthcoming):

### Investment and the Transfer of Power: Dynamic Effects of Transmission in Electricity Markets

* Abstract: Renewable resources are required for energy transition, but not all locations have abundant renewables. Additional transmission provides a potential solution and allows for transfer of renewable power from renewables-rich to renewables-poor areas. I examine the impacts of increased long-distance transfer of electricity on the investment choices of fossil fuel and renewable generators. I detail and estimate a dynamic model for generator behavior consisting of a short-run optimal-dispatch problem for the operations market with consideration of the effects of line losses and transmission constraints between zones and a long run dynamic game for the capacity market. I run counterfactual experiments to analyze the impacts to consumer welfare, emissions, and reliability as well as incentives for investment in renewable energy.

## Working Papers

### Offshore Horizons: HVDC Wind Farms - Exploring Techno-Economic Dimensions. (With Deepi Singh, Gaurav Bhansali, Ali Anwar, Shreepooja Singh, Fang Luo, and Yiyi Zhou. Submitted at IEEE Access.)

* Abstract: High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) technology is a cornerstone of efficient Offshore Wind Farm (OWF) power transmission. This review examines HVDC OWF integration through four interlinked dimensions: economic considerations, connection topologies, converter designs, and technical modeling. It begins with an in-depth economic analysis, evaluating cost-effectiveness, reliability, and market dynamics, focusing on investment, operational costs, and lifecycle expenses. Building on this foundation, the review explores various collection and transmission architectures, highlighting their technical trade-offs, and evaluates power converter designs for efficiency, reliability, and offshore adaptability. Finally, advanced modeling and simulation techniques are reviewed to optimize system performance, enhance reliability, and balance computational efficiency. Throughout each of the four sections, economic and technical constraints are considered together. This helps to improve understanding of how systems can be designed in a way that meets the constraints of both fields and to improve feasibility on both dimensions. Together, these insights provide a holistic framework for sustainable and economically viable offshore wind energy integration.
