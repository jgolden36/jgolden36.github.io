Disseration Description: Investment and the Transfer of Power: Dynamic Effects of Transmission in Electricity Markets
======
## Renewable Energy and Transmission Challenges:

* Renewable resources are essential for the energy transition, but availability varies across locations.
* Additional transmission infrastructure can transfer renewable power from resource-rich to resource-poor areas.

## Research Focus:
* Examines the impacts of increased long-distance electricity transfer on investment decisions by fossil fuel and renewable generators.

## Dynamic Model Development:

* Models short-term operations in the dispatch market, accounting for line losses and transmission constraints between zones.
* Develops a long-term dynamic game for generator behavior in the capacity market.

## Dataset:
* US grid buildout since 2000 for Eastern Interconnection and ERCOT
* Approximated hourly generation and exports by generator from 2018 to 2023

## Counterfactual Experiments:
* Analyzes impacts on consumer welfare, emissions, and grid reliability.
* Evaluates incentives for renewable energy investment under varying transmission scenarios.
