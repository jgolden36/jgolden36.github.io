I am a PhD candidate in economics. My work merges energy economics, industrial organization, and machine learning. My main work focuses on the impacts of transmission on generation investment in American electricity markets. I am also conducting interdisciplinary research on transmission systems for offshore wind, the macroeconomic role of metals markets in the energy transition, the role of professional networks in job finding as it relates to the racial income gap, the use of natural language processing to create explainable forecasts in commodity markets, and corporate finance. I love policy and research, and I hope to turn my passion for energy economics into real change to help drive forward the energy transition. Below you can find an overivew of current research projects with a brief description of each:

Investment and the Transfer of Power: Dynamic Effects of Transmission in Electricity Markets (Disseration)
======
Renewable resources are required for energy transition, but not all locations have abundant renewables. Additional transmission provides a potential solution and allows for transfer of renewable power from renewables-rich to renewables-poor areas. I examine the impacts of increased long-distance transfer of electricity on the investment choices of fossil fuel and renewable generators. I detail and estimate a dynamic model for generator behavior consisting of a short-run optimal-dispatch problem for the operations market with consideration of the effects of line losses and transmission constraints between zones and a long run dynamic game for the capacity market. I run counterfactual experiments to analyze the impacts to consumer welfare, emissions, and reliability as well as incentives for investment in renewable energy.

Offshore Horizons: HVDC Wind Farms - Exploring Techno-Economic Dimensions (with Deepi Singh, Gaurav Bhansali, Ali Anwar, Shreepooja Singh, Fang Luo, and Yiyi Zhou)
======
High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) technology is a cornerstone of efficient Offshore Wind Farm (OWF) power transmission. This review examines HVDC OWF connections through four interlinked dimensions: economic considerations, connection topologies, converter designs, and technical modeling. It begins with an in-depth economic analysis, evaluating cost-effectiveness, reliability, and market dynamics, focusing on investment, operational costs, and lifecycle expenses. Building on this foundation, the review explores various collection and transmission architectures, highlighting their technical trade-offs, and evaluates power converter designs for efficiency, reliability, and offshore adaptability. Finally, advanced modeling and simulation techniques are reviewed to optimize system performance, enhance reliability, and balance computational efficiency. Together, these insights provide a holistic framework for sustainable and economically viable offshore wind energy transmission systems.

Explainable Commodity Market Forecasting using Natural Language Processing (with Dikshya Mohanty and Khushboo Singh)
======
Commodity markets are inherently more physically-driven and information based than equities markets. The knowledge requirements in commodities has typically made these markets more reliant on text-based information than other markets are. A cottage industry exists of economists using text data to understand commodity market movements. New transformer-based architectures have revolutionized the practice of natural language processing. However, many commodities predictions trained on news sources suffer from a lack of validity due to an inability to separate fact from opinion in news reports. Our paper solves this problem by utilizing the government reports commonly published in commodity markets to train a transformer-based model on a form of text ground truth and then fine-tuning the model on news reports. The model is tested on news reports from out of the sample, and results are reported.

Optimal Sizing and Bidding Strategy for Colocated REG-ESS in the Presence of Contracts for Differences
======
Energy storage systems have proved remarkably valuable for the operation of renewable energy systems. This value has only grown over time as larger renewable systems require larger storage systems. The primary mechanism for this interaction comes through smoothing the ups and downs of renewable energy generation and facilitating participation in the capacity and ancillary services markets; however, an increasingly common consideration in renewable energy systems with energy storage systems (REG-ESS) is the potential for arbitrage. 

The literature on bidding for co-located REG-ESS is relatively mature within the engineering literature; however, the potential for equilibrium effects in this market has not been substantially examined. Almost all papers consider energy resources as price takers. However, this is not necessarily a valid assumption. In recent years, major development in offshore wind in the United Kingdom and industry concentration has led to some hours where the majority of power came from several operators of wind turbines. In many cases, this leads to curtailment. The addition of energy storage offers an interesting possible dimension to competition between renewable energy operators that would uniquely benefit from an equilibrium model. We develop a game theoretic model of optimal sizing and bidding of REG-ESS in a multi-agent environment and show potential impacts of CfD in an environment with multiple players with large enough power capacity to influence pricing. We further provide a reinforcement learning based simulation to show the impacts of CfD on agent behavior. We further provide reduced form evidence of how CfD impacts behavior of REG-ESS operators in practice.
