These are my slides for Economics and Sustainability. It is an interdisciplinary course focused on the economics of sustainable systems. It provides an introduction to environmental economics at a less mathematical level and is directed at practitioners.

## Lecture 1: Introduction to Machine Learning for Economists: Intro to Course, Intro to Python, Intro to Pandas

Here is the introductory recitation in machine learing. I cover an introduction to Python and Pandas and review math for machine learning:

## Lecture 3: Introduction to Machine Learning for Economists: Dimensionality Reduction Techniques and Model Validation
This recitation covers basic Dimensionality Reduction Techniques and Model Validation. I discuss and walk through code on PCA, LDA, and provide thoughts on cross-validation and avoiding overfitting.
