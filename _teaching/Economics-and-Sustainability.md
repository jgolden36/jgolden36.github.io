These are my slides for Economics and Sustainability. I taught the course in Spring 2022 and Fall 2023. It is an interdisciplinary course focused on the economics of sustainable systems. It provides an introduction to environmental economics at a less mathematical level and is directed at practitioners in the field of sustainability. The textbooks are Introduction to Sustainable Development by Peter Rogers, Kazi F. Jalal , and John A. Boyd and Environmental Economics An Introduction by Barry C. Field and Martha K. Field.

The course is split up between Mondays and Wednesdays lectures, which focus on course content, and Fridays recitations, which focus on applying what students learn.
