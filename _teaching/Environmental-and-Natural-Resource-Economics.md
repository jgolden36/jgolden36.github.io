Part one: Environmental Economics
======
## Lecture 1: Introduction to Environmental Economics

Here is the the first lecture on environmental economics. It covers a review of applied microeconomics, a review of basic math for economics and the important concepts that form a basis of environmental economics.

## Lecture 2: Externalities, public goods, and markets

This lecture covers externalities and public goods at a mathematical level to provide the context needed to analyze market failure.

## Lecture 3: Imperfect Information and Insurance Markets
This lecture covers imperfect information and insurance markets including discussions of adverse selection, moral hazard, and the principal agent problem. It overviews how these concepts interact with environmental economics.

## Lecture 4: Cost-benefit Analysis

This lecture focuses on cost-benefit analysis in environmental economics. Discounting, LCOE, and LACE are discussed in detail and examples are provided of how to use NREL tools to analyze the cost-benefit problem of the generator.

## Lecture 5: Non-market Valuation

This lecture focuses on non-market valuation in environmental economics. Both revealed preference and stated preference methods are covered. Particular attention is given to estimation of damage functions and hedonic price equations as well as discrete choice modelling for non-market valuation.

## Lecture 6: Environmental Macroeconomics
This lecture focuses on the basics of using macroeconomics to think about the macroeconomic implications of climate change. Green GDP is covered at a high level. The Solow-Swan growth model with natural resources and the Green Solow Model are discussed followed by a broad discussion of the environmental Kuznets Curve. Next, I get into Integrated Assessment Models with the example of DICE. Then, I discuss computational general equilibrium frameworks including GTAP and GCAM. I finish by talking about ESG investing.

## Lecture 7: Data in environmental Economics and Geographic Information Systems
This lecture is split into two parts. The first focuses on utilizing data in environmnetal economics while the second focuses on geographic information systems. Example code is provided.

Part 2: Natural Resource Economics
======
## Lecture 1: Commodity Markets

Here is an introduction to commodity markets. The lecture starts with a broad overview of commodity markets and current issues. This is followed by a discussion of commodity market supply models including the workhorse Hotelling model of natural resource extraction, the Hubbert's Peak model of mineral extraction, and the recent application of industry cost curves to commodities market supply. The lecture concludes with a discussion of commodity market demand including an overview of Nerlove's Partial Adjustment model and how to explain the commodity supercycle within a neoclassical framework.

## Lecture 3: Electricity Markets
This recitation covers basic Dimensionality Reduction Techniques and Model Validation. I discuss and walk through code on PCA, LDA, and provide thoughts on cross-validation and avoiding overfitting.

## Lecture 4: Bidding in Electricity Markets

This recitation covers Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Pytorch, and Huggingface. I show talk about recent advancements in neural networks and how they relate to economics.

## Lecture 5: Economics of Nuclear Power

This recitation covers decision trees, random forests, Sklearn, and Boosting methods including Adaboost. I show to implement algorithms from scratch and in Sklearn.

## Lecture 7: Environmental justice (optional):
This lecture takes a broader stance and applies a more interdisciplinary approach to consider how to think about the distributional impacts of the modern metals market.
